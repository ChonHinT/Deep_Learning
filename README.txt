Just a starting point for you if you get stuck with similar project(s).

A1 Model: Single layer perceptron

A2 Model: Convolutional neural network (CNN)

A3 Model: Recurrent Neural Network (RNN)

If you don't have a clue how to start with RNN, this video may be a good starting point: <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AsNTP8Kwu80>
